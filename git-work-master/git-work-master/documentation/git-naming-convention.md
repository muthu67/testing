## Naming Convention                          

### General Guidelines

* Choose short and descriptive
* Use dashes to separate words.
* Use lower case.
* Do not use bare numbers as leading parts. Example: BUG198483
* Avoid long descriptive names.

### Branch Name Guidelines

* Use *slash* to mention supporting branch type.
* Pattern to follow: 
    < supporting-branch-type > / < reference-id > - < short-description >
    
    For examples:

```shell

    feature/e4823-login-signup
    feature/e19423-login-forgot-pwd
    hotfix/ms1023-xss-patch
    hotfix/bz2131-login-sqlchange
    release/v1.0.12
    bug/bz29823

```
